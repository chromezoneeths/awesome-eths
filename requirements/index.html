	<h1>Requirements</h1>
	<div>To be included in Awesome ETHS, your project must meet the following requirements.</div><br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The project must be primarily developed by a current or former ETHS student. This includes substantial forks by
			students of existing software by non-students, or software developed as a team with a mix of students and
			non-students.
		</li>
		<li>
			The project must be respectful of its users; it must not be predatory or exploitative.
			Examples of predatory/exploitative software include client-side software with a subscription payment plan,
			software which collects more user data than is necessary, and software which handles user data irresponsibly.
		</li>
		<li>The project must be in a state where its intended functions are mostly in place and working correctly.</li>
		<li>If the project is proprietary, it must be marked as such.</li>
	</ul>
